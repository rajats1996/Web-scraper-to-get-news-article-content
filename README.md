# Web Scraper Project

This project is a web scraper built using **Scrapy** and **Selenium**. It is designed to scrape articles from websites, extracting key information such as the title, content, updated date, and byline.

## Features

- Scrapes article titles, content, updated dates, and bylines from web pages.
- Handles Javascript rendered content using Selenium.
- Saves the scraped data to local files for further analysis.\
- Customizable to scrape different websites by modifying the spider.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Scrapy
- Selenium
- ChromeDriver (managed automatically by 'webdriver_manager')

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
'''bash
git_clone <repository_url>
cd web_scraper_python
'''

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
'''bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
'''

3. Install the required dependencies:
'''bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

### Usage

1. Navigate to the Scrapy Project Directory:
'''bash
cd web_scraper
'''

2. Run the spider with the desired URL:
    '''bash
    scrapy crawl quotes -a url=<article_url>
    '''
    Replace '<article-url>' with the URL of the article you want to scrape.

3. The spider will extract the following information:
- **Title**: The title of the article.
- **Content**: The main content of the article.
- **Updated Date**: The last modified date of the article.
- **Byline**: The author or attribution of the article.

4. The extracted data will be saved to a local file in the format 'article-<page>.txt'.

## Example

To scrape the article at 'https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/scenic-airport-landings-2020/index.html', run:
'''bash
scrapy crawl quotes -a url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/scenic-airport-landings-2020/index.html
'''

The output will include the article's title, content, updated date, and byline, and save it to a file named 'article-index.txt'.

## Notes

- Ensure that the website you are scraping allows web scraping by checking its 'robots.txt' file.
- If the website uses JavaScript to load content, Selenium is used to render the page and extract the required data.
